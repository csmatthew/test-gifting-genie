We used [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Philgck/gifting-genie/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to create a project board and populated it with user stories and added labels according to MoSCoW prioritisation.
All of the 'must have' user stories ###### are/were not completed ~~with any other issues being carried over to the next sprint of the project development.~~

![Project Board](readme.docs/project_board_Moscow_labels.png)

Each user story had acceptance criteria added.The fulfillment of the criteria for each of these can be demonstrated by the presence of the features on the site (see below). The CRUD funtionality of the 'Event', 'Wish List' and 'Friends' models were tested extensively throughout each development phase both manually and through automated unit tests.

## DESIGN

### Typography

The website uses the following fonts:

- **Arial**: The primary font used throughout the website for its clean and professional appearance. Arial is a widely available sans-serif font that ensures readability and consistency across different devices and browsers.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme of the website is designed to provide a clean, non-intrusive background that is easily viewed in both light and dark modes. This design choice follows a style often used by information and education sites, such as Wikipedia. The primary colors used are:

- **Black and White**: The almost black and white color scheme provides a neutral background that does not distract from the content. This ensures that the text is easily readable and the images stand out.
- **Accent Colors**: 
  - **Blue (#005eff)**: Used for links, buttons, and other interactive elements to draw attention without being overwhelming.
  - **Green (#28a745)**: Used for positive actions such as the "Add Comment" button.
  - **Yellow (#ffc107)**: Used for the "Return Home" button to provide a bright, noticeable call to action.
  - **Red (#e0a800)**: Used for hover states to indicate interactivity.

The palette was chosen using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

### Imagery
- **DALL·E**: AI-generated images via Chat GPT that provide unique and creative visuals for the blog posts. 
- **Pixabay**: Royalty-free stock images that are used to complement the content. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

The 'Gifting Genie' icon is used as the icon to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the website. The same icon is included both on each page in the Navbar and as a recognisable icon as the favicon for the tab. [Procreate](https://procreate.com/)

### Layout and Styling

The website features a consistent layout and styling across all pages, ensuring a cohesive user experience. Key design elements include:

- **Header**: The header contains a collapsible navbar that is consistent across all pages. It includes links to the main sections of the website, such as ~~Home, Nuclear Facilities, Nuclear Fuel & Waste, Nuclear Defence, Nuclear Power in Space, Fact or Fiction, and Educational Resources.~~ The navbar also includes login and signup links for unauthenticated users and a logout button for authenticated users.
- **Collapsible Navbar**: The navbar is designed to be responsive and collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. This ensures that the navigation is accessible and user-friendly on all devices.
- **Footer**: The footer is consistent across all pages and includes links to social media apps Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. It maintains the same styling as the header, providing a cohesive look and feel across all pages.
- **Main Content Area**: The main content area is designed to be flexible and accommodate various types of content, including text, images, and interactive elements. It is styled to ensure readability and a pleasant user experience.

### AI AUGMENTATION 
## Leveraging AI Tools for Code Creation ##
<!-- During the development of the 'Nuclear Knowledge' nuclear physics blog app, I utilized GitHub Copilot to assist in code creation. Copilot provided valuable code snippets and suggestions that accelerated the development process. Key areas where AI was used include:
- Generating Views and Templates: Copilot was instrumental in generating Django views and HTML templates. For instance, the initial structure of views such as nuclear_facilities, nuclear_fuel_waste, and nuclear_defence were generated using Copilot. These snippets provided a solid foundation, which I then manually checked and modified to fit the project's specific requirements.
 - Form Handling: Copilot assisted in creating forms for user input, such as CommentForm and TopicForm. The generated code snippets were reviewed and adjusted to ensure they met the application's validation and processing needs.
 - File and Directory Management: Copilot was invaluable in reminding me of the numerous files and directories to amend when new models, views, or features were introduced, ensuring that all the correct files were updated.
While Copilot provided a significant boost in productivity, it was essential to manually review and modify the generated code to ensure accuracy and alignment with project requirements. -->

- AI-Assisted Debugging
<!-- GitHub Copilot played a crucial role in identifying and resolving bugs. Key interventions include:
  - Error Handling: Copilot suggested error handling mechanisms for views and forms. For example, it provided initial code for handling form validation errors, which I then refined to improve user feedback and error reporting.
  - Debugging Views: When encountering issues with view logic, Copilot suggested potential fixes and improvements. These suggestions were cross-referenced with the current code using tools like Diffchecker and W3S to ensure the changes were appropriate and did not introduce new issues.-->

Manual use of Diffchecker was crucial in comparing Copilot's suggestions with the existing codebase, ensuring that only the most relevant and accurate changes were implemented.

- Optimizing Code for Performance and User Experience
<!-- Copilot was also used to optimize code for performance and enhance user experience:
  - Efficient Query Handling: Copilot suggested optimizations for database queries, such as using Django's select_related and prefetch_related to reduce the number of database hits and improve performance.
  - Responsive Design: Copilot provided initial CSS and JavaScript snippets to enhance the application's responsiveness. These snippets were manually adjusted to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices using my own color choices and fonts, as well as Bootstrap and Flexbox for structure and positioning.-->

- Generating Django Unit Tests
<!-- Copilot assisted in generating Django unit tests to ensure code coverage for key functionalities:
  - Test Logic Generation: Copilot generated initial test cases for views, forms, and models. For example, it provided test cases for creating, editing, and deleting comments, as well as liking and unliking topics. These tests were reviewed and adjusted to improve accuracy and completeness.
  - Ensuring Code Coverage: Copilot's suggestions helped ensure all critical paths were tested. For instance, it generated tests for edge cases, such as handling invalid form submissions and testing user permissions.
The generated test logic demonstrated a basic understanding of the application's functionality, and manual adjustments were made to ensure the tests accurately reflected the intended behavior.-->

- Additional AI Tools
<!-- In addition to GitHub Copilot, other AI tools were leveraged in much lesser forms:
  - Perplexity: Used for generic questions regarding feature planning and implementation, providing valuable insights and information.
  - Microsoft Copilot: Assisted in generating user stories and blog content based on key information provided by myself.
  - ChatGPT DALL·E: Used to create custom images, including the landing page masthead, enhancing the visual appeal of the application. However due to a daily 'image creation limit' the images were developed in stages. 
  - DeepSeek: Trialed for its excellent insights into processes applied to problems. However, it was often unavailable due to high traffic.-->

- Reflection on AI Tools
<!-- Using GitHub Copilot and other AI tools significantly enhanced the development process by providing relevant code snippets and suggestions. They accelerated the initial coding phase, assisted in debugging, and ensured comprehensive test coverage. However, it was essential to manually review and adjust the generated code to ensure it met the project's specific requirements and maintained high standards of quality and performance. Copilot can occasionally repeat itself despite clear prompts, as if it 'forgets' the previous steps or the focus of the initial query, which can be time-consuming. It is crucial to know when to manually take over reviewing the code.-->

  ### HTML validation

I have used the W3C Markup validator to validate all of my HTML code - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Pages in this project are developed using DTL and all except the landing page (and login, logout and sign-up pages which are Django admin tools that I have no control over) require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use the URL so I followed the below approach for the landing page and the templates:
  - navigate to the deployed Heroku link
  - right click to find the 'view page source' link
  - copy and paste the HTML code from here into the validator via the direct input

[home page html validation](readme.docs/...)
[A MODEL page html validation](readme.docs/...)

HTML was checked and ~~had no errors or warnings to show as indicated above.~~
~~The home (landing) page had some initial syntax errors which were identified and corrected and then commited the code and the validation was clear.~~

   ### CSS validation

[CSS validation](readme.docs/css_validation.png)

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested.

   ### Javascript validation

  [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validator was to be used - did not throw up and issues. 

   ### Python validation 
[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the python files I created or edited myself see table:

## Lighthouse scores from Heroku deployed app via Chrome dev tools 
![lighthouse](readme.docs/Lighthouse_testing-result.png)

The performance score is ~~acceptable.~~
 - Accesibility ~~88% (close to the 90% breakpoint!) was due to an insufficent contrast ratio of the heading text in the masthead image (which can be improved in future sprint) although it passed 10 audits.~~

~~Although I attempted to remain focused on the core tasks, I also integrated several additional features, such as:~~
